By {MARK MUGWERE AGIMBA}

Description
{A simple dice game I created so as to help us practice and understand better the concepts that we have covered throughout this week. These include working with constructors, prototypes, objects, properties and methods in Javascript as well as using jQuery and DOM manipulation & traversal.}

Setup/Installation Requirements
{Any web browser e.g Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.}

BDD
{On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the die. However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just the total earned during that particular roll.
A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling the die) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.
When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.
The first player to get 100 is the Winner!}
