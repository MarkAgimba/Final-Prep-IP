        <h3><strong><u>How to Play:</u></strong></h3>
       <p style="color:blue;">On a player's turn, they are to roll the die repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the die. However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just the total earned during that particular roll.</p>
       <p style="color:blue;">A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling the die) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.</p>
       <p style="color:blue;">When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.</p>
       <p style="color:blue;"><span class="font-weight-bold">The first player to get 100 is the Winner!</span></p>
